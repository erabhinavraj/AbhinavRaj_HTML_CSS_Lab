I have combined all three assignments into a single cohesive web page, showcasing the integration of a Navigation Menu Bar with Dropdowns, a Vertical Animated Bar Graph, and a Gmail Account Creation Form. Each of these elements is implemented with HTML, CSS, and animations, providing a comprehensive demonstration of HTML and CSS skills while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

1. Navigation Menu Bar with Dropdown List
The first feature includes the creation of a Navigation Menu Bar located at the top of the page. This navigation bar has three primary links:

Link 1
Link 2
Link 3
The following functionalities have been incorporated:

Header Creation: A header section was added at the top with a clean and bold appearance to provide a professional look.

Navigation Bar:

Each link in the navigation bar is styled with appropriate padding, width, and background properties.
For Links 2 and 3, dropdown menus were implemented. When the user hovers over Link 2 or 3, a dropdown menu appears with three sub-links: DD_Link_1, DD_Link_2, and DD_Link_3.
Various CSS properties like width, height, hover effects, color, padding, and background gradients were applied to maintain a modern and smooth navigation experience.
The dropdown menus were styled to include shadows and spacing to ensure a clean and functional look.
This part of the code demonstrates proper use of HTML <nav> elements, dropdown menus, and CSS properties like hover states, transitions, and positioning, ensuring a visually appealing and interactive navigation experience.

2. Vertical Animated Bar Graph
For the second feature, a visually dynamic Vertical Animated Bar Graph was added. This graph demonstrates CSS animations and HTML structure to create an engaging, interactive representation of data.

Animated Bars:
Upon page load or refresh, three bars animate from bottom to top, reaching predefined heights representing 30%, 40%, and 80%.
Each bar is positioned centrally on the page with appropriate height adjustments to visually represent percentage values.
The text displaying the percentage values (like 30%, 40%, 80%) appears below each bar, ensuring clear readability.
An h1 element with the text "Bar Plot" is placed below the graph to provide a label for clarity.
The use of CSS animations, keyframes, and positioning properties allows these bars to dynamically and smoothly animate, creating a visually appealing bar graph. This section demonstrates proficiency in CSS animations and transitions, ensuring fluid, professional interactions.

3. Gmail Account Creation Form
The final feature is the Gmail Account Creation Form, which combines good form design principles with functional input validation and styling.

Background Integration:
The form is set against a background image/video that is fixed, providing a visually engaging interface.
Input Focus Effect:
When a user focuses on any input field (Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Password), the background color changes to a light steel blue with a 0.35 opacity effect, enhancing the visual interaction.
Form Components:
The form contains fields for Full Name, Email, Phone Number, and Password.
Two buttons, Submit and Reset, have been added:
The Submit button stores user input.
The Reset button clears all the form fields instantly.
The form is encased in a bordered container with padding, rounded corners, and a clean layout to ensure a neat appearance.
This part of the code utilizes HTML form elements, input validation, and CSS styling techniques like focus effects, padding, borders, and background adjustments. It showcases the integration of user experience best practices and modern web design aesthetics.

Conclusion
By combining these three features — Navigation with dropdown menus, an animated bar graph, and a functional Gmail account creation form — into a single web page, I demonstrated a well-rounded understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, animations, and responsive design principles. The page integrates essential web development concepts such as:

HTML5 semantic elements
CSS animations and transitions
User interaction effects
Form handling and input validation
Each part of the code was carefully designed and integrated to showcase not only technical proficiency but also attention to user interface design, responsiveness, and aesthetic appeal. This project effectively highlights the ability to create visually interactive and functional web components, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience while maintaining modern web design standards.
